# Automating Unity builds with DevOps (Getting Started Series)

Building Unity projects, especially as projects get larger and larger gets very laborious.  Build times get longer, you can't use your machine while it's building and there is simply not enough coffee in the world to fill the void in your heart when Unity just crashes half way through.  It can be tough.
Through Unity Cloud Build, Unity does provide a quick way to automate builds but it can contain hidden costs and is not all that flexible (at the time of writing), they are working on it and improving it all the time but they are still leagues behind where the big cloud providers are.
Through this series you will discover the true power of building your Unity project in the cloud and all the extra power you can access and at very little cost (as in none).
