 Thanks to creating your site in [Part 1](/_posts/2022-03-08-getting-started-with-blogging-using-github-pages-and-jekyll.md) and theming your site in [Part 2](/_posts/2022-03-11-Applying-a-theme-to-your-GitHub-pages-site.md), you already have a nice looking site, maybe with a little flair, it is time to start writing some content.  Whether that content is a blog post or a regular page for your site, you want to make writing easy and if at all possible, avoid installing any tools.

 Well, thankfully GitHub still has your back thanks to the awesome [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the web editor built right in to the GitHub website.

 ## VS Code on the web

 GitHub includes a web version of [Microsoft's VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that runs on the web, integrated tightly with GitHub, featuring:

* PR review
* Code editing
* Source Control (GitHub) integration
* Markdown writing and preview
* And much more (however the 4 above are the main uses)

This is accessible from either the Code view below, or when you are reviewing a pull request (but more on that another time)

While in the code view you can either:

> Tap "." on the keyboard

or

> Change the GitHub url from "**.COM**" to "**.dev**"
> E.G. *GitHub.com* -> *GitHub.dev*

This will result in the Code editor view you see below:
