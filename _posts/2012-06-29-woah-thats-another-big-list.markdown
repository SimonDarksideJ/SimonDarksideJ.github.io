Over @ [pixel prospector](http://www.pixelprospector.com/indev/tag/pixelprospector-special/) there is a vast (and I do mean vast) list of links to help out the aspiring indie dev in the whole marketing area.  Why is this important, because if people do not know about your game they wo not go looking for it.

Here is a good example, one of my favourite game some time back was Star Wolves (not an indie title granted, just an example), they marketed the hell out of it, I saw it and bought it.  Loved it.

A few years later I was browsing a shop in India (during one of my trips with work) and while glancing at the PC games section and my eyeâ€™s came across Star Wolves 2.  Eh, what happened there, I have been watching this game since it was launched and I had not even heard of it (I bought it and it turned out to be rubbish, but that is beside the point [![](/resized-image.ashx/ __size/1000x0/__ key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/darkgenesis/2158.wlEmoticon_2D00_smilewithtongueout.png)](/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/darkgenesis/2158.wlEmoticon_2D00_smilewithtongueout.png)  )

Truth is, no matter how good your game is, if people do not know about it they are unlikely to look for it or even buy it.
