When I first got into Game Development I thought I had a fairly rough idea of what I was getting into.

I can program (I'm fairly proficient having learnt several programming languages along the way), I'm crap at art but so what and I'm good at concept and designing.

First thing you find out when you get to the graphical side is you need one other thing:

**Maths**

Which I used to be good at in school all those years ago but these days, I have a computer for that – **_Damn_**

From all my meanderings I've gleaned some parts of knowledge:

## 1: First what are you getting yourself into this for?

### Fun

OK then just enjoy

### Professional

Time for a wake up call, you'll first need to choose which area you intend to work (Design, Graphics, Physics, AI, Engine Programming, Behaviour Programming...), there are lots of areas and for all but the smallest games, one man doesn't fit the bill, even specializing in 2 areas will take a lot of effort.

Also for most areas that include programming, unless you've done something similar then the rough timescales for learning this stuff is about 4 years! (Digipen www.digipen.edu, specialize in Computer games programming courses, suggest this very strongly, possibly longer depending on your programming level)

P.S – understand where the ideal may sound grand the reality is that it is a very hard road, tight deadlines always looming and in a lot of cases the money is not great. You really need to be in the game if you love the creation of something for people to get their teeth into and enjoy themselves.

Me, I'm in for the fun of it and what I learn along the way, I ain't going to be writing the next version of doom any time soon.

## 2: What is the scope of what you want to achieve?

### Start selling games right away

This is one of the more adventurous goals, in this most of the guides suggest a strategy of using tutorials and guides and follow the complete game creation process:

Concept – Design – Review – Prototype – Programming – Graphics/Modelling – Test – Bug fix – Review – Packaging – Documentation

There are several good guides for following all this, most of the work (graft) will be done in the first three stages, without even touching a programming IDE, it's a lot of work you should only spend about 20% of the entire project-ish programming the beast (on your own)

### Learning for fun

The approach I've been taking which suits me best at the moment is to learn more before I attempt the above, most guides tell you to start in deep and learn the tough way.

Personally I enjoy the learning itself for now, use what time you can to understand what is required from a programming point of view, by all means layout a game design goal (2D, 3D, RTS, RPG, FPS) and learn across that route first, learn about the Game cycle (one thing I never thought of), the different methods for graphic placement, Bitmaps graphics and such.

Learn the wilds of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in a gaming concept, it does have its own wilds (so I've found)

If using DirectX for a foundation for your game, start reading up on it from guides and such.

I'll blog more about my approach as weeks go on (and probably start getting shouted at)

## Conclusion

Once you've thought about these points, choose the approach that fits you.

My way may not suit others, everyone has their own path, albeit some through a fiery chasm, over a long wooden walkbridge just to answer my questions three. Ahem.

If you're here for fun or do not mind my incessant ramblings (findings) then I hope you enjoy the future.
