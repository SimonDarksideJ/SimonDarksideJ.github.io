I came across several lists in my past about what book to read, where to go N Such, but over at [Next-Gen](http://www.next-gen.biz), they have [compiled a list](http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3962&Itemid=34&limit=1&limitstart=0) as a consensus from some big names in the industry.

Not just about writing games either, the books range the following areas:

  - Theory
  - Design Practice
  - Writing
  - Graphic Design
  - Music / Audio
  - Online Community
  - The History of Games
  - Sociology
  - People, Projects, and Businesses
  - Other Media and Useful Disciplines
  - Deep Background
  - Inspirations

Some truly helpfuly and inspiring stuff, so if you are new to the game creating area or even If you're looking for more (although you probably have your hands full already), header over to [Next-Gen](http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3962&Itemid=34&limit=1&limitstart=0) and see how many you have already and what could possibly be missing from your collection.

One of the newer books that made it onto the list apparently has already sold out it’s first edition run, hmm
