### Enter the next stage of the Mixed Reality Toolkit

After months of hard labour, cross words and more debates that you can shake a relatively large stick at, the Mixed Reality Toolkit finally entered the Beta phase.

This marks the first “release” ready for developers to start prototyping, building projects and hacking away to build fantastic Mixed Reality experiences.

Featuring:

- A new cross-platform architecture
- Scriptable configuration
- A new componentised layout
- Support for WMR and OpenVR right out of the box (Just hit play)
- And Much, much more.

It is not at feature parity with its predecessor the HoloToolkit, but it showcases a new path / generation for the Toolkit, seeking to be more open, resolve old issues and strive to be the one toolkit to take on the world of Mixed Reality (or Cross-Reality if you prefer). It is also not recommended for production use just yet (although legend tells, that it is already being used for future projects by Microsoft and other MR Partners already).

Dig in, try it out, see what you think and let the team know Good or Bad what you like or would want to see improved.
