So,as I have mentioned before, I am part of a group called [Dark Omen Games](http://darkomengames.co.uk/), and we have finally got around to getting a [Creators Club](http://creators.xna.com/en-GB/)Premium membership so we can start to release our games on the Xbox Live Creators Games.

As my post title suggests, the first game we are putting up is Nebulon, the brain child of Dave Bonner.

Nebulon is a 2D top down shooter, you fly your ship around looking for alien “photons” to warp in so you can shoot them. You have to be quick though, they like to gang up and if to many get together there is the chance of a wormhole opening up and something nasty coming out..

Here are a few screen shots:

As you can see it can get pretty funky.

Here is a clip (pre play test drop):

If you have a [Creators Club](http://creators.xna.com/en-GB/)Premium account, please get on a give it a play test, we really would love to hear your feed back on it so we have a solid, robust game going into peer review.

You can leave your comments here, on the play test forum for Nebulon or on our [blog](http://darkomengames.co.uk/).

So get your trigger fingers at the ready and start blasting some photons!
