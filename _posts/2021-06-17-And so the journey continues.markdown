It was always my mantra, even from the very early days, some 20 years back.</p><p>However, in the latter years, although I have been "out there", supporting who I can and wherever they are, I have not been as forthcoming with my blogging efforts.  There are numerous reasons for this, trials, tribulations and for those who know me best, some hardships and the eternal battle with impostor syndrome.</p><p>But as ever, to grow we must push on and keep doing the small things which help keep us on the straight and narrow, all the while busting the door open to new opptunities. Confused, I hope so, as I am usually in a constant state of bewilderment, until I find that one article, document or person that sets the record straight.</p><hr><h2 id="new-adventures">New Adventures</h2><p>Part of the longing to get back in to blogging/vlogging/etc has been the start of a new career with an absolutely awesome team at xRealityLabs, headed by the totally amazing boss that is Gareth James.
