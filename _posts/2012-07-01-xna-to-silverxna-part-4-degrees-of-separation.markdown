title: XNA to SilverXNA-part 4 Degrees of Separation

In yet another area that will be completely foreign to XNA devs (unless you’ have delved into Silverlight or Web programming) is the concept that in reality you should never have code updating the screen directly.

In XNA this is unavoidable simply because XNA is the only thing that draws to the screen and has complete control over everything however the same principle can also be applied to XNA games just to simplify and centralise where all the information comes from when presenting it to the screen, lost yet?, well lets continue.

What we are talking about a design pattern called MVVM, others do exist which are all based on the same rough idea (MVC, MVP, etc), the diagram below aims to help visually represent this (image courtesy of [John Papa’s article](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2011/08/15/fundamental-mvvm) on Visual Studio magazine [here](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2011/08/15/fundamental-mvvm)):

![width=](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2011/08/15/~/media/ECG/visualstudiomagazine/Images/2011/08/wcpp0815FigL.ashx)

As the diagram shows the view (or screen) is independent of the rest of the project just getting information it needs to drive the user experience from a ViewModel (collection of settings), other parts of the application that need to update the information just update the ViewModel as well (in our case the game).

With this separation it means we cannot break (except in rare circumstances) the display of our app or game and it also means we can pass off the final screen presentation to a designer to craft our screen against an agreed set of information the app/game will work with.

All gobbledegook, well I suggest reading a sample of the following articles:

Why do I bring this up?, well as part of this article we will aim to further simplify and box off sections of our game to make it both easier to maintain and add a degree of control while we use Silverlight, one of the big benefits of Silverlight is it is data binding capabilities which means you do not have to (but you can do if you want do) manually update every control on the screen with values from your app/game, the screen is designed to listen to those values and automatically updates appropriately, that can include animations and other cool things as well!.

## Framework, I do not need no stinking framework

Now you can do all this manually by using the iNotifyPropertyChanged interface throughout your code to sort all this out but it’s just far simpler to use a robust framework to do most of the grunt work for us, my framework of choice is the MVVM Light framework for Windows Phone which is both light and provides MVVM functionality (I bet it took Laurent a whole 5 seconds to come up with that name ![Open-mouthed smile](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile3.png)) and now that the Windows Phone SDK 7.1 also support NuGet in the Express Edition this is just a few clicks away.

Open up the SilverXNA project in Visual Studio Express and right click on the references folder in the main SilverXNA project:

[![image](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image63.png "image")](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image61.png)

If you do not get the “Manage NuGet Packages” option then you most likely do not have the latest tools installed (You need the RTM version or above).

Select the NuGet option and you will be presented with the NuGet Package manager, from here you can search for and install new packages or see if there are any updates to existing installed one’s.  This is truly an invaluable tool which is a great addition to the express tools.  Unfortunately there is no online review library of NuGet packages (that I’m aware of) so you will have to rely on searching or reading about your favourite packages on the web but full details about each package are available through the package manager.

[![image](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image64.png "image")](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image62.png)

Search for MVVM and you should see the list above with the package we want right at the very top (as you can see there are lots of other MVVM packages out there so if you feel like trying a few others then feel free to experiment with what’s good for you), for now just click install on the MVVVM Light package.

When it is installed you will see it has done several things, it is installed and added references to the MVVM light libraries and added some template files for use as well.  If there were any dependencies on other packages then they would have been installed as well all with a single click of a button, simples!.

| [![image](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image65.png "image")](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image63.png) | So from the screenshot left you can see:

> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    The MVVM Light libraries for WP7 7.1  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    A new folder with some template files  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    The App.XAML has also bee updated with new configuration

NuGet can do some astounding things with packages so it is realy something to keep an eye on.

Usually the packages also come with a ReadMe file to aid with any additional setup tasks that are required to get up and running but it is missing in MVVM light at present but not to worry I know what I am doing……

## A New view for an old face

In short this is how MVVM Light operates on Windows Phone (it is not exactly the same for all frameworks).

You have a page and corresponding ViewModel for that page which work together to present information to the screen safely.  Behind that you have a ViewModelLocator, this is the wiring panel behind the scenes that connects everything up, in more advanced cases it also provides the capability to plug in different data sources for your models from a central location providing another level of abstraction.

It is all words at this point and I’m only going to go over the simple things for now so it all becomes clearer, to see the advanced stuff in MVVM I suggest going through the material mentioned earlier, they are truly fantastic.

You can have Models to also describe your data but in this instance it is a but too much so in effect our game is our model and engine driving what is being sent to the screen in SilverXNA IMHO.

Enough of this lets get something done.  if we analyse what we are currently using as data to send information to the screen in our Gamepage.XAML.cs (remembering that from a MVVM / Silverlight approach, storing values in our code behind is generally not a good idea because it cannot be reused) there are a few things (well a lot really but we are still keeping to baby steps, you can experiment later) that we could do with taking out of there, namely:

> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/006.gif)    The Level attribute – used to see what our current level is and persists information about the player state  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/006.gif)    The value for drawing the Time remaining to the screen  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/006.gif)    The value for the players score  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/006.gif)    A maintenance value for how long should pass before the player should be warned time is running short

These are the core things we want to look at in this session, there are several others (most of them really) that a page should not need to know about but we will leave them along for now.

So lets add out GameViewModel for our GamePage, just right click on the “ViewModel” folder and select “Add –\> New Item”, click on the “Silverlight for windows Phone” branch in the tree on the left and select “MVVMViewModel (WP7)” then give it a name of “GameViewModel.cs”

[![image](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image66.png "image")](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image64.png)

If the project templates do not show up in the “Add New Item” browser then you can get them from the [MVVMLight codeplex page](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/releases/71278/download/267119 "MVVM Light Full installer package"), else you can just copy the “MainViewModel.cs” file and rename it to “GameViewModel.cs” (remembering to also rename the classes and methods within since VS Express does not do this for you like the full studio edition)

Once you have done that open it up and it should look something like this:

     ![image](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/image68.png "image")
    
    MVVM also comes with a heap load of code snippets to make building out our View Model all that more easier (See why I love that Laurent guy), hit tab twice and exploding onto your screen will be a nice new fully fledged property all wired up for MVVM:
    
    
    
    
        
    
        Type “GameLevel” and hit Tab – this is the property public name  
     ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    Type “Level” and hit the right arrow– this is the type for the property, in this case it is not recognised but we will fix that afterwards, we have to use the right arrow key because hitting tab would cause intellisense to make something up, lol  
     ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    Type “\_gameLevel” and hit tab – this is the private name for the property  
     ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    Lastly we have a choice to make as there are two options for how MVVM notifies Silverlight of changes to values, either throu a simple notification or whether it broadcasts it through messaging.  Too much to go through here so for now just remove the “NotImplemented” Line (a safety measure to ensure you check this) and the second “RaisePropertyChanged” line which talks about messaging.  
     ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    To finish off right click on the red squiggle for the Level type and resolve the reference.
    
    So you should be left with the following:
    
    
    
    
        
    
        WarningTime (type Timespan)  
     ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    GameTime (type TimeSpan)  
     ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/004.gif)    GameScore (type int)
    
    Feel free to add them yourself or just copy the entire GameViewModel.cs from download package mentioned at the start of the chapter.(do not forget to resolve any missing references, like TimeSpan)
    
    
    
    Now to add some additional features which will aid our end design for the page and show off a bit of what MVVM can do for you with Data Binding.  The first one we will add is a new Property to display the GameTime as a string, you can just show the TimeSpan value as test however with you get days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds it can look a little busy.  You may ask “Well why not just fix up the existing property to output a string?”, simple answer the XNA game outputs a TimeSpan and we do not want to mess with that, plus it is best not to try and mess with the core properties, bit of a standards thing.
    
    
    
    There are other ways of doing the next bit in Silverlight by using Converters but this is just my preferred way, if you want to look up converters then [check out this article here](http://bit.ly/oPsbee "Introduction to Silverlight Converters") (Converters are for transforming data for presentation in XAML)
    
    
    
    So add the following cut down property:
    
    
    
    
        
        
            
            
                
                
                    article on WindowsPhoneGeek which appeared recently or go back and watch Laurent’s videos again.
                    
                    For now we are just going to add our View Model to the existing View Model Locator and wire it together, nothing fancy.
                    
                    
                    
                    So open up the ViewModelLocator.cs and add the following three things:
                    
                    
                    
                    > ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/006.gif)    Declare the static variable for maintaining the reference to the view model in the header of the ViewModelLocator class
                    > 
                    >     
                    > 
                    >     Copy the property section for the Main View del and rename it to GameViewModel and update value names:
                    > 
                    >     
                    > 
                    >     Finally and arguably the most important!, in the constructor for the ViewModelLocator, instantiate the GameViewModel variable

                    >     
                    > 
                    > )
                    > 
                    > Now there are plus sides and downsides to that last section, in reality what we should be doing is only instantiating the GameViewModel when it is first called in the exposed property to comply with proper singleton design patterns, but we are keeping things simple here, plus as this is a game we need that data there as the game starts anyway to get things moving.  In other models where your would use an IoC container and dependency injection there are other practices as well, Laurent goes over this in detail in his Deep Dive session.

                    > So first off open up the GameView.XAML and add this section to the end of the list of namespace declarations:
