Knowledge is power and with what [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview)are doing to educate the masses , then they must be very powerful indeed. Training and educating developers far and wide, growing their own developer army.  Or they could just be very nice people ![Open-mouthed smile](/assets/img/wordpress/2014/10/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile.png)

[Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview)’s “[Succinctly](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks?UTM_medium=simonblogreview)” series, one of the largest free set of technical books covering everything from languages, to source control systems and beyond. It has grown at a steady rate since I last reviewed their collection and boy do they still like just giving it away for free.

Let’s see what has changed this time.

##### ![ /></h5>
<p>It has been over 2 year now since <a href=](http://i2.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/_Un0JJ6ChsQE/TDMGeB1LpyI/AAAAAAAAABU/VORQN7I2LVg/s1600/27.jpg?w=660)Syncfusion started shipping free [ebooks](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) to the developer community, you would think they would have run out steam by now but still they power on, they are relentless.

Each book averages around 100 pages and contains targeted and focused knowledge to make use of some of the new and upcoming frameworks or development tools out there.  In fact in this review they have even branched out in to some very interesting sectors, such as Neural Networks and Service Stack.

The series has grown to an immense 48 titles and still they are powering on with no end in sight. it really does show how much [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) value the community and it is a great business vehicle to get you interested in their commercial offerings.

The free stuff does not stop there as [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) also offer an Icon repository tool with over 2500 icons called  [MetroStudio](http://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) (or should that be ModernStudio now ![Smile with tongue out](/assets/img/wordpress/2013/07/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png?w=660))

<p>You cannot argue with the price and the wealth of information in each book, it is just fantastic.  Need I say more?</p>
<h6>Pros:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ever growing set of titles, if you have not subscribed to updated you are sorely missing out!</li>
<li>Each book is aimed at the beginner, little or no foreknowledge is required</li>
<li>Available in PDF or Kindle so choose your reader</li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons:</h6>
<ul>
<li>They do not cover everything about a subject, just what you need to understand and get going. Although this can be forgiven, they are FREE after all</li>
<li>They have not yet been featured or shown on a hit tv series <img src=](http://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-YJZ1X0X20x8/T6MOhBQk54I/AAAAAAAAB-8/WgJn-q4Ohaw/s1600/My+Thoughts.png?resize=450%2C139) (but didn’t I see one hidden on the last episode of Lost?)
* * *

![ /></p>
<p>I have read so many of these titles (not all, I am not that good. I have a very busy schedule you know) and have yet to be disappointed, they are concise and to the point.</p>
<p>They are an excellent launch board for learning about new technologies or ways of thinking, almost makes me want to write for them as well (maybe I will <img class=](http://i2.wp.com/www.magicalmaths.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/conclusion-introduction-starter-plenary.jpg?w=660)).

If [Syncfusion’s](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview)track history is anything to go by you can expect their commercial offerings are also going to be of the same grade and quality

 

You really cannot go wrong here, whether you want to learn more about the topics at hand or need Icons for your project it would seem [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) is the place to look.
