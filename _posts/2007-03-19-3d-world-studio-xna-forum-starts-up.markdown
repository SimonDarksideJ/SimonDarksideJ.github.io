I’ve been in talks with Leadwerks, who make 3D World Studio and they seem very interested in getting into the XNA domain.  
They have started up a forum for XNA users to post to for help or info.

[http://forum.leadwerks.com/viewforum.php?id=28](http://forum.leadwerks.com/viewforum.php?id=28 "http://forum.leadwerks.com/viewforum.php?id=28")

Joshua Klint, who I was chatting with has also posted on the XNA forums as well in the [Artists Corner](http://creators.xna.com/forums/thread/3067)

Hopefully a lot of good could come from this, maybe another XNA partnership who knows!

Also [Johnnylightbulb](http://www.codeplex.com/johnnylightbulb "http://www.codeplex.com/johnnylightbulb") is close to finishing his content processor for 3D World Studio files, so you can use the proprietary format instead of exporting everything to .X.

A little snippet of what is possible with the Mapping engine, hmmm
