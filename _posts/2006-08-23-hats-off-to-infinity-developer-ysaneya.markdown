I’d recommend any one with some spare time on their hands to wander over to the [Journal of Ysaneya.](http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/mod/journal/journal.asp?jn=263350)

That guy is going from strength to strength with his [procedurally generated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) game world

![](http://fl-tw.com/Infinity/Media/Screenshots/nebulae38.jpg)

just one of the latest creations (this time with nebula’s, previous work includes procedurally generated worlds and landscapes) and all procedurally generated, damn fine work.
