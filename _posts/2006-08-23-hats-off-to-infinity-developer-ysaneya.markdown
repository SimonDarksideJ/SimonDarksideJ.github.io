I'd recommend anyone with some spare time on their hands to wander over to the [Journal of Ysaneya.](http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/mod/journal/journal.asp?jn=263350)

That guy is going from strength to strength with his [procedurally generated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) game world.

Just one of the latest creations (this time with nebulas, previous work includes procedurally generated worlds and landscapes) and all procedurally generated, damn fine work.
