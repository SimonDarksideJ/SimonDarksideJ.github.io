Following the announcement on the [Channel 9 show](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/LauraFoy/Windows-Phone-7-Apps--Tools/) this week, the crowd in the Windows Phone 7 and XNA teams have published a whole raft of new samples, including:

* * *

> [**Accelerometer**](http://creators.xna.com/sample/accelerometer)[   
> ](http://creators.xna.com/sample/aiming)This sample for Windows Phone demonstrates using the Accelerometer sensor in XNA Game Studio 4.o as well as supplies an Accelerometer wrapper that can be used to easily implement Accelerometer functionality in your games    
> [**Bounce**](http://creators.xna.com/sample/bounce)   
> This sample for Windows Phone demonstrates Sphere to Sphere and Sphere to Plane physics through use of the Accelerometer   
> [**Fuzzy Logic**](http://creators.xna.com/sample/fuzzylogic)   
> This updated sample for Windows and Windows Phone shows how an AI can use fuzzy logic to make decisions. It also demonstrates a method for organizing different AI behaviours, similar to a state machine.
> 
> [**Touch Thumbsticks**](http://creators.xna.com/sample/touchthumbsticks)[   
> ](http://creators.xna.com/sample/aiming)This sample demonstrates a technique for using the touch panel to provide thumbstick-style controls for a game on Windows Phone.   
> [**Waypoints**](http://creators.xna.com/sample/waypoints)   
> This sample demonstrates basic navigation using waypoints. Waypoints has been updated to support touch controls on Windows Phone.   
> [**Sprite Sheet**](http://creators.xna.com/sample/spritesheet)   
> This updated sample for Windows and Windows Phone shows how to implement sprite sheets, combining many separate sprite images into a single larger texture that will be more efficient for the graphics card.   
> [**Stock Effects**](http://creators.xna.com/sample/stockeffects)   
> This Stock effects sample for Windows provides source code for the five effects (BasicEffect, SkinnedEffect, EnvironmentMapEffect, DualTextureEffect, and AlphaTestEffect), and the default shader used by SpriteBatch (SpriteEffect), built into the XNA Framework. There also is a command-line utility (CompileEffect) that uses the Content Pipeline to compile a .fx source file into a binary blob that can be passed directly to the XNA Framework **Effect** class constructor.   
> [**Content Manifest Extensions**](http://creators.xna.com/sample/contentmanifestextensions)   
> This sample for Windows shows how to build a list of deployed content for your game to use.

* * *

That is a whole load of content, get reviewing.

Although the bounce sample, which was the first one I looked at, has code missing.  This is however being addressed.  Make sure you show your application in the forums for each sample.
