In case anyone’s interested, the [XBOX360 Homebrew contest](http://xbox360homebrew.com/blogs/default?GroupID=11) has now entered the voting stage and all development is complete on the competition entries.

They have been [posted here](http://xbox360homebrew.com/files/default) and I’d encourage everyone to head over and look at the games entered.  I’m really impressed with the entries so far.  Sounds daft but I didn’t enter the competition to win but to kick-start my game writing experience.

I’m happy with my entry, it works, the game plays fairly well (even if it’s only the basic connect mode so far) and I got the manual in the game as well as with it.

The gam isn’t as as graphical as I’d like but the process showed me just how much work I got to do in that area along with learning [shaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaders) (graphical touchup’s and effects).

Head over there if you have time and give your support to all the hard work of the contestants!
