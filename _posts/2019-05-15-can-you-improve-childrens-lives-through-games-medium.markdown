I have worked in healthcare for the past 2 decades professionally with healthcare software, ever since my Son was born with an untreatable genetic condition.  I have wanted to “Pay forward” to all those clinical staff who helped us through our early years by creating better software to enable them to care more (and type less).

However, my work with the Fizzyo project to help the treatment of children with Cystic Fibrosis has been the most challenging and rewarding of my developer life.
