 As a side note and not really about game programming, an extract from (strange place indeed) the Dilbert Blog, good old Scott Adams has some ramblings about his past in business, life and such.

Brings out the of-told truth that for every success in life your likely to have on average 9 failures (1 in 10) and points out that this really does just become a fact of life and not to be deterred by it.

 

An interesting read and in reality this applies to game design as well, for every really good idea that works well in your game your probably going to have several either very stupid (on reflection) or mildly annoying ideas, which ones you choose to implement mostly relies on personal experience, or more likely trial and error, I’ve lost count how many times I’ve had to debug a problem only to find out I left something in which was very bad!.

Any Read on!!
