 Nelson Hurst over @ Nelxon – [http://www.nelxon.com/journal/entry-1002/xdsk/](http://www.nelxon.com/journal/entry-1002/xdsk/), (pronounced “nell-zahn“) has pulled together some of the best resources around the web to assist the indie development community in their prospective creations.

Links ranging from the different components of game engines like Physics, AI and Particle engines to full blown engine and lighting resources.

A lot of the links are codeplex projects which could be found by other means, but this list takes the cream of the crop and pulls them all together in one place.

What I really like is that Nelson has been very objective in this list, citing other projects over his own creations and showing the benefits of some above others.  Even listing hi arch-rivals web/blog page.

So I highly recommend a visit and browse the links, you’ll find some cool gems in there.
