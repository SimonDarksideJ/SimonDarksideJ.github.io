not much to comment on here, not blogged for quiet a while now since the purchase of my new PDA

Damn useful things for just sapping out your brain into text.

So have devoted a lot of my spare time now to getting thoughts down for Life (my Pet game project), got more done in the last months than I’ve even spent on writing the core engine behind Life.

 

Bustling on.

 

On a side note, keep an eye on a project called [eXperience](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View?ProjectName=eXperience) on [Codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com/), group of guys making a repository of Game Components for [Microsofts XNA Game Studio](http://msdn.com/directx/xna/gse) – Great work guys, keep up the good work.!!
