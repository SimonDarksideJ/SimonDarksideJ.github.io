Catching up on the webcasts I’ve done now for AT&T, here’s the recording from the second event from last month (March) on Web Connectivity for windows phone

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=" http:>Meet the Expert – WP7 and the Web (Part 2 of 2 in the Scoreboard Series) from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user5386443">Simon Jackson</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</iframe>

In the webcast we covered:

- Connect up to the backend WCF service for the scoreboard
- Grabbing Data from the service
- Populating the view model with the service data
- Data validations
- Extension methods
- Making the web calls process simpler using Reactive Extensions
- Doing basic HTTP web post calls
- Doing HTTP post calls reactively 

That’s me done for webcasts for a little while. i wouldn’t recommend doing three in one month to anybody but it was certainly one hell of a ride.

For now i’m doing a few snippet webcasts for [Blender](/controlpanel/blogs/posteditor/blender.org)to [SunBurn](http://www.synapsegaming.com/products/sunburn)which I’ll summarise here ([like this one](/blogs/darkgenesis/archive/2011/04/06/sunburn-snippets-helper-series-for-getting-started-with-the-sunburn-game-engine)) but are being posted on my [3D blog](http://faux-motion.blogspot.com) (as it’s about Blender really)

now I really should stop helping out and get back to my own projects, but I know I’ll still struggle
