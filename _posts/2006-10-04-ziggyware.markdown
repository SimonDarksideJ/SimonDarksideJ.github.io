Seems these sites are multipling somewhere, Soon we’ll have XNA rabbits no doubt.

In the front of doing some sprite animation and rotation research for Hack-1, I can across yet another XNA site featuring tutorials, so far there are only 2D tutorials but what w wealth fo information here, especially good if you are new to this.

Current Tutorials are:

 ![src=]() [Creating a B2 Spirit Texture](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=55)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Math](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=54)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Simple Overhead Shoot-em-up](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=53)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Rotated Sprite Per Pixel Collision Detection](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=52)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Texture Manager](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=51)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Simple Overhead Shooter](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=50)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Simple Sample Game](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=49)
 ![src=]() [XNA – 2D Per Pixel Collision Detection](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=48)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Parallax Mapping](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=47)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Using Effect (FX) Files](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=46)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Custom Vertices](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=45)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Drawing Text in XNA](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=44)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Using the Mouse](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=43)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Rotating a Sprite](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=42)
 ![src=]() [XNA – Writing to Texture Surface](http://www.ziggyware.com/readarticle.php?article_id=41)

There are lots of other usefull bits of information and seems to be well thought out (although some of the tutorials talk about creating custom bits for stuff that are already in XNA now but likely these were written bofore XNA was released)

in other delvings I came across Andy Dunn’s (ZMan) excelent MSDN webcast of an introduction to shaders, WOW hats off to ZMan, it sometimes is a shocker how big some things are if you’ve not properly looking into them and Shaders are one of those things

[WebCastEventDetails-EventID=1032296889&EventCategory=5&culture=en-US&CountryCode=US](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails?EventID=1032296889&EventCategory=5&culture=en-US&CountryCode=US)

You can find out more about the ZMan at his website @ [http://www.thezbuffer.com](http://www.thezbuffer.com)

or on his blog – [www.indiegameguy.com](http://www.indiegameguy.com), he also frequents the MSDN forums offering lots of help and advice.
