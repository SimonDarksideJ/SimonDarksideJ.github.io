This one from  Mike Schuld’s, [The Ramblings of a Hazy Mind](http://www.thehazymind.com/ "The Ramblings of a Hazy Mind") site.

Mike has updated his 3D tutorial on using his custom XNA 3D engine, lots of goodies on

- Framework
- Scene Graphs and Object Framework
- Shaders and Cameras
- Camera Movement and Simple Input logic
- The building of a simple Skybox

All goodness and now with Beta 2 support, get your whites even brighter with that wash.

So for a day or so break from all competition woes, head over to Mikes’s place and rummage around a bit.

As a side note, on Dave "[LetsKillDave](http://letskilldave.com/default)" Weller’s blog, he’s noted some good example games also upgraded to Beta 2 to browse though and a little hint of some Movie goodness from the XNA team on how to get the best from the content pipeline.
