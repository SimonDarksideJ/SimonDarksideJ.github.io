As promised for a while now, I am writing a series of tutorials for updating the GUI in my [Mastering Unity 2D Game Development](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-unity-2d-game-development#) book to the all new and sparkly UI system that Unity introduced In version 4.6.

 

Now, these bonus chapters are not going to teach you the in’s and out’s of the new UI system, that is what my title [Unity 3D UI Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/unity-3d-gui-essentials) is there for but I will be going through everything you need to update your RPG games with some new UI tricks.

I will be breaking this set of tutorials down to cover each of the UI elements / screens covered within the book, offering tips and guidance  as to how to make the most of the UI system for each individual piece.

The specific elements of GUI \> UI conversion we will be covering are:

- The store front – starting easy with this simple single screen UI.
- The conversation and navigation system – showing dialogs on screen
- The player inventory screens – layouts with a big of additional drag and drop maybe
- The Command bar / battle interface – The on screen command bar interface, complete with cooldowns
- The turn by turn battle system, possibly with a little health bar logic

> I will add the links to each tutorial as they are covered off to this post

 

Once this series is complete, we will return to the core of the book and look to building a simple questing system, something a fair few readers have asked about.

Please bear with me as the series unfolds, going as fast as I can to give you the upmost quality and fitting in the day job as well.
