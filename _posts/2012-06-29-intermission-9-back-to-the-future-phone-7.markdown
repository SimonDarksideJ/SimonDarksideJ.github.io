Marty you gotta see this…. (whoops, back to the tutorial)

Hope you are not getting to dizzy now going back and forth from XNA GS 3.1 and GS 4.0 and the windows phone.  But lets bring the phone project up to date with current efforts and also wrangle out some gotcha’s that have come to light.

**Source updated for Final combined update project for GS 4.0 project [here on Codeplex](http://startrooper2dxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/61496) (Windows and WP7)**

* * *

 

### Game save settings

Granted we do not have many settings to actually maintain on the phone at present, but we could have (like resolution, game speed, difficulty and such) and in the interest of at least attempting to make the GS 4.0 code ready for running everything we will add it in.

So first off copy the “FileManager.cs” and “KeyMappings.cs”, then update their namespace to match the rest of the project, “XNAStarTrooper2D\_Phone7”.

Now it would be nice if that was it but first we have some alterations to handle, first up.  The windows phone, unlike XBOX and windows does not use storage containers, instead it uses something called Isolated Storage.  Pretty much the same thing just a different name.  Second it has a slightly different way of creating files, so we will deal with that as well.  What it boils down to is that pretty much all of our code in the File Manager is useless.  So why copy the File Manager class in at all, well that is to try and keep the project unified.

So first we need to add compiler pre-directives around our existing code first, so add:

    
    
         1: #if (!WINDOWS\_PHONE)
    
    
    
    Just after the Class definition and add the following just after the SaveKeyMappings function:
    
    
    
        
        
             1: #else
        
        
        
             2: public static void LoadKeyMappings()
        
        
        
             3: {
        
        
        
             4: using (IsolatedStorageFile appStorage = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication())
        
        
        
             5: {
        
        
        
             6: using (IsolatedStorageFileStream file = appStorage.OpenFile("StarTrooperControls.sav", FileMode.OpenOrCreate))
        
        
        
             7: {
        
        
        
             8: try
        
        
        
             9: {
        
        
        
             10: XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(InputMappings));
        
        
        
             11: Input.SettingsSaved = true;
        
        
        
             12: serializer.Serialize(file, Input.InputMappings);
        
        
        
             13: }
        
        
        
             14: catch{}
        
        
        
             15: 
        
        
        
             16: }
        
        
        
             17: } 
        
        
        
             18: }
        
        
        
             19: 
        
        
        
             20: public static void SaveKeyMappings()
        
        
        
             21: {
        
        
        
             22: using (IsolatedStorageFile appStorage = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication())
        
        
        
             23: {
        
        
        
             24: using (IsolatedStorageFileStream file = appStorage.OpenFile("StarTrooperControls.sav", FileMode.OpenOrCreate))
        
        
        
             25: {
        
        
        
             26: try
        
        
        
             27: {
        
        
        
             28: XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(InputMappings));
        
        
        
             29: 
        
        
        
             30: Input.InputMappings = (InputMappings)serializer.Deserialize(file);
        
        
        
             31: }
        
        
        
             32: catch { }
        
        
        
             33: 
        
        
        
             34: }
        
        
        
             35: }
        
        
        
             36: }
        
        
        
             37: }
        
        
        
             38: #endif
        
        
        
        If done right, you should see all the code greyed out, this pretty much leaves us with a blank class definition for windows phone while still retaining the functionality for other platforms.
        
        
        
        But we still see several red wavy lines under the xml serialisation functions.  This is because the protection around DLL’s have changes (you will see this a lot) and the serialisation implementation has been updated slightly.  This is not a biggie, just right click “References” in the solution explorer and select add reference, then select “System.XML.Serialization” and click ok.  Finally add a using reference in the top of the class:
        
        
        
            
            
                 1: using System.Xml.Serialization;
            
            
            
            So we have added two new overloads which are Windows Phone specific thanks to the Pre-compiler statements, this means we do not need to change the rest of the game code for saving and loading, although in hindsight, the name of the save and load functions could do with renaming now ![Open-mouthed smile](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/06/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile2.png) (something for later when the projects unify).
            
            
            
            The two new functions use the phone specific way of saving and loading data, which is very similar to the XBOX version:
            
            
            
            > ![](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/039.gif)    Instead of Storage Container we use Isolated Storage, the major advantage of this is that we do not need to use the guide to get the user to choose a container, it is all built in.   
            > ![](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/039.gif)    How we access files is slightly different, we still use streams but as with the isolated storage, it is a lot simpler and easier to use.   
            > ![](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/039.gif)    No change in the serialisation, except that we now need to manually add a reference to the Serialisation DLL
            
            
            
            To finish it off we need to add another pre processor directive to the using section of the class around the Storage statements and also add a reference for isolated storage, so replace:
            
            
            
                
                
                     1: using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage;
                
                
                
                With:
                
                
                
                    
                    
                         1: #if (!WINDOWS\_PHONE)
                    
                    
                    
                         2: using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage;
                    
                    
                    
                         3: #else
                    
                    
                    
                         4: using System.IO.IsolatedStorage;
                    
                    
                    
                         5: #endif
                    
                    
                    
                    Last thing to update is in the KeyMappings class.  Just remove the [Serializable] references (apparently they are only needed for binary serialisation).  You can also remove all using statements except Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input (this is a good general rule of thumb, to only declare what you actually intend to use in your code, same can be said of references).  I will tidy up more later.
                    
                    
                    
                    To update the main game to load and save settings, simply add the following in to the LoadResources function of StarTrooperGame.cs:
                    
                    
                    
                        
                        
                             1: //Try and load any saved key mappings
                        
                        
                        
                             2: FileManager.LoadKeyMappings();
                        
                        
                        
                             3: 
                        
                        
                        
                             4: //If no settings present or setting were unable to be loaded, use the defaults
                        
                        
                        
                             5: if (!Input.InputMappings.SettingsSaved) Input.Load\_Defaults(); 
                        
                        
                        
                        And so that our settings are saved when the game finishes, change the exit code at the start of the Update section to:
                        
                        
                        
                            
                            
                                 1: // Allows the game to exit
                            
                            
                            
                                 2: if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed)
                            
                            
                            
                                 3: {
                            
                            
                            
                                 4: FileManager.SaveKeyMappings();
                            
                            
                            
                                 5: this.Exit();
                            
                            
                            
                                 6: }
                            
                            
                            
                            This adds a call to Save Settings before we exit.
                            
                            
                            
                             
                            
                            
                            * * *
                            
                            
                             
                            
                            
                            ### Particle Engine
                            
                            
                            The changes to the particle manager are also fairly cosmetic and mainly involve replacing:
                            
                            
                            
                                
                                
                                     1: SpriteBlendMode.Additive
                                
                                
                                
                                To:
                                
                                
                                
                                    
                                    
                                         1: BlendState.Additive
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    Then:

                                    So copy in the “ParticleManager.cs”, “ParticleEmitter.cs” and “ParticleEmitters.cs” classes from the 3.1 project and make the above changes.
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    Then like before, we just need to add the particle engine references in the game itself like in the last post, these comprise of:
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    Particle Manager attribute in the start of the StarTrooperGame class:
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                        
                                        
                                             1: public static ParticleManager ParticleManager;
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        Ant the particle manager initialisation in the StarTrooperGame constructor:
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                            
                                            
                                                 1: ParticleManager = new ParticleManager(this);
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                                 2: this.Components.Add(ParticleManager);
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            Then we need to add the new Fireball effect in the StarTrooperSprites.cs file, just after the TrooperFire function in the Trooper class:
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                                
                                                
                                                     1: void FireballLaunch(Vector2 position, Vector2 velocity, Vector2 accel)
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                     2: {
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                     3: 
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                     4: FireballSmokeParticleEmitter smokeemitter = new FireballSmokeParticleEmitter();

                                                And add the call to the TrooperFire function:

This enables us to change the speed of the background later.

However if the background was moving up this would not work.

Turns out he was dead right.
