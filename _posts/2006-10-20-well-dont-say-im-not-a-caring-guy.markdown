As life moves on it seams I get less and less done, even while using the XNAhomebrew contest to kick my rear into gear (hay that rhymes) and get Hack-1 off the ground, first 2 weeks full steam ahead…… Last 2 weeks Nahda.

As you’ve probably seen from earlier comments I made the mistake of finding other things to look at (very bad.) but needles to say I’m rushing back in and have even componentising (is that a word, my spell checker doesn’t seem to think so) a lot of my code to make re-assembly into other things a lot easier.

2nd thing I’ve been doing is my least favorite thing, graphics.  The Editor window is almost ready and the Main Game screen is 1/2 way there, the components that will use these are not stuck with my initial version and can support multiple within the game, my modding hat on for later.

On another note, just a few mentions of interesting stuff I’ve come up with this week.

Derek over at [www.threesixbox.com](http://www.threesixbox.com/) seem to be collecting a lot of XNA goodness, so I’d suggest a good look.

In case your struggling to find stuff out there I’d suggest trying this new search engine [http://msdewey.com/](http://msdewey.com/ "http://msdewey.com/") , if nothing else it’ll make you smile while you search (thanks to letskilldave for that little titbit)

Interesting developments from [http://www.paradeofrain.com/](http://www.paradeofrain.com/ "http://www.paradeofrain.com/") who has a little 2d Camera system tutorial growing

Lastly the coding4fun site is almost ready to shed it’s skin and don it’s new look, wander over to  [Coding4Fun v2 Update- Final Designs](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2006/10/19/coding4fun-v2-update-final-designs "Coding4Fun v2 Update- Final Designs") to see the latest productions and hopefully more content when it goes live (so were promised)

Dat’s all for now, back to drawing board…
