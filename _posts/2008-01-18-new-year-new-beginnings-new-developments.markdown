Time being what it is, I seem to have less and less to play with.  One of the biggest casualties has been my Game Development progress, including this blog.  That is not to say I’ve stopped completely (9i’v still got my hands in and do my best to keep up to date with everything going on, especially with the XNA 2 release and the new developments with WiiWare) but time is just diverted to other things such as below.

[![20071228-Nathan Samuel first pics 023](http://by1.storage.msn.com/y1p4HghUv1HukKb_6yUcUkok9q6CntQvb7aLrX0EvHogAqCPbLKjI2lFuoBWXgEnJMdqSj4gFMGNm7tzEtKe3VGNW27hjLAFHxG?PARTNER=WRITER)](http://guwpaw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pIQGrzYTKBM-XbafefDvvahPSCfrleinjItveoMjwxej_rb8eqrVZM21KPWoDRRODbdKNI97IT4cYIyZBT9AKEZeHINAQlxJ6?PARTNER=WRITER)  Little Baby Nathan Samuel found his way into the world on DEC 28th despite all the odds stacked against him, lovely as he is. (and in case your wondering, that now makes 4, including 1 accident and 1 miracle, as in should not have been medically possible after 3 years, damn human body :-))

Work is the other Factor which has been hell of late, deadlines approaching and such.  At least Charles over at RandomChaos has been holding up the Lanky Brit front and has been releasing some great content, we chat regularly and I am truly amazed by what he has achieved in a short span of time.  his blog recently moved on to the every successful XNAUK user group site, lots going on there as well.

As for the future, I’m focusing on what I can, scratching up designs for games (pad and pen easier to come by and doesn’t annoy the wife) and checking out the background devising for the games while keeping up to date with all new things.  (my blog list is far tooo long).

For the last if anyone is wondering what the heck my new logo is, then visit [this link](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/cat_microsoft_blue_monster_series.html)and shout out "Microsoft, Change the world or go home".  New/old way of thinking of how to get a job not only done but done well and in a way that is productive.  Either that or do it right or get lost!, has several meanings.
