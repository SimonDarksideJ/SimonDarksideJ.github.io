> Need to update this list and move it to a better place, such as github

I’ve been around the game development arena for so many years now that it actually hurts if i try to think back too far ![Open-mouthed smile](/assets/img/wordpress/2013/08/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile2.png), it is always been as a hobbyist working on a string budget (and sometimes I couldn’t afford the string) so I always had to make best use of what I had and everything else, well, lets just say it is been fun.

One thing that has piled up over the years is my massive collection of links to FREE (or nearly free) resources to help out those building games, some are assets, others are the best samples of free tutorials to either build your own or craft simple items in to much much more.


##### \*\*Note – in the land of hunting for FREE do not think because it uses the word “free” that it has no restrictions. ALWAYS check the license (most just want attribution or mention). Be very aware of “Royalty Free” which only means it is free to use AFTER you buy it

So without much todo and very little formatting here is the first drop (so many links, takes time to go through them), all work (Checked as of 22 August 2013).
