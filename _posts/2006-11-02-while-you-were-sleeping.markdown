Well as I mentioned in my last post, XNA Game Studio express Beta 2 would be coming soon and lo and behold what did I find while checking my blog posts this morning, just this lovely little post from the XNA team

## XNA Beta 2 Released

Well the XNA teams post and several others from the noted team (and people who were up a lot earlier than myself), so I’m off now to update my project to Beta 2 and make use of the content pipeline and some of the other notably better features.

For the XNAHomeBrew competition I do not think it matters which version of the studio you use so long as it works at the end of the day but I did enter the competition for a challenge and there nothing more challenging than starting over (ish, well updating my code), at least my hard didn’t fail and I feel sorry for the guy it happened to.

TTFN and happy downloading.

I will make one point, read the README that comes with the download first (I usually do not but hayho), there is an important point about uninstalling XNA beta 1 first, running C# Express before installing Beta 2 and also a registry fix for those of you who use the full studio on the same box (XNA uninstall reregisters stuff it really should not, although this is fixed in Beta 2)
