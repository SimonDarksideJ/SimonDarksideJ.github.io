After clearing away all the drinks, party streamers and general clutter from the launch party, a few stragglers were found loitering in the rubble, so we picked a few randomly and awarded them some prizes.  Well almost.

 

It was one hell’uv’a party and there was lots of fun, now that the winners have accepted and the various prizes handed out, I can announce their names!

I would like to thank everyone who entered and helped to spread awareness of my latest title, you are truly awesome people.

To everyone who has bought the title since, I award you and wish you well on your game development adventures! As always my door (aka forum) is always open.

 

It does seem (at least my publisher informs me) that this title is fast beginning their fastest selling title in the past year, only narrowly being beaten by a pesky title on Angular JS (at the time of writing).  Go Go Gadget UI
