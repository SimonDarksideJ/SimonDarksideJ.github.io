if your learning 3D, one of the best places to go is the good and the great [XNA101.net](http://xna101.spaces.live.com/) site (now hosted on Live Spaces and Run by Bill Reiss). 

Now over @ [Riemers.Net](http://www.riemers.net/index.php), the bar has been raised slightly (sorry Bill), in the [second part](http://www.riemers.net/eng/Tutorials/XNA/Csharp/series2.php) of the 3D tutorials here, Riemers has written a tutorial for a full 3D flightsim style game (bear in mind this can be changed into almost any form you wish).  I’ your new to the field I’d recommend spending the time (best a couple of weeks) to fully digest all the tutorials hosted here from beginning to end, like most tutorial sites each new tutorial is based of the previous!.

There are several veins of tutorials as Riemers as now converted some of the tutorials over to XNA now that it is released, so wether you are a DirectX geek or an XNA Noob, you’ll get the information you need.

Also on Riemers site there is also a very good [HLSL (SHADERS)](http://www.riemers.net/eng/Tutorials/DirectX/Csharp/series3.php) tutorial set, I’ve mentioned it before but what the hell.

Only thing to note is the navigation is not obviously apparent as Riemers site is full of Ad’s, nothing against this but is does clutter up the site some, if I were to make an observation, it would be good if Riemers site offered the tutorials in some downloadable format as well as web or to add _forward_ and _back_ buttons at the top and bottom of each page.  To navigate the site, use the navigation bar on the right hand side of the screen and click to each section.

Each section is titled appropriately for each language, there is even a section for VB, for those who are orientated that way for games Dev.

Back on the VNA101 front Bill has now upped his tutorial count to 23 (Wow), in his new style of creating a 3D hockey game, the tutorial is a very good step by step approach rather than Reimers full on approach and Bill describes each concept accurately with links to more information where Bill is only providing the basics!.

Enjoy them both, I’m sure your learn a lot
