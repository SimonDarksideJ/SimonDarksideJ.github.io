I’m not usually one for cross promoting sales or offers from vendor sites, there are better ways to do it.

In this case however this is one too good to miss.  you might have seen the various reviews I’ve done for PacktPub books of late (just writing up on a video series called “[Mastering Unity Scripting](http://www.packtpub.com/mastering-unity-4-scripting/video "Mastering Unity Scripting - PacktPub")“) and there are a lot of great titles in their catalogue.

So grab yourself a bargain while the offer is available.
