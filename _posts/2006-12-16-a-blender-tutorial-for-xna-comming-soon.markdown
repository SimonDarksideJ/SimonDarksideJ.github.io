Lots of goodness over the weekend, the biggest (as titled) is that [Mykre](http://www.virtualrealm.com.au/blogs/mykre/default), posts that after a change of job, the choice of 3D tools available has reduced to the free one’s, namely Blender.

SO in the coming weeks (months?) Mykre is going to start posting a tutorial about using blander and using blender models in XNA, great stuff.
