After the Techdays conference I re-recorded the SunBurn demo I did due to a glitch that happened on the day (typical, always has to happen on a live demo), i’ve not even been able to replicate the conditions that happened on the day so I’ll chalk that one up to a meltdown.

I figured out it was the camera in the end (it just decided to go for a wander), but as you can see in this demo (which is an exact replica of the demo on the day) I did nothing really different.

Only thing I added was importing a model, which I did just prior to the event just to save time (and I have to stop talking to myself in bracketed comments like this =D )
