> XNA Game Studio Express 1.0 Refresh has been released and is available for [download](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/aa937795) right now! For members of the XNA Creators Club, you will be receiving a Title Update on your Xbox 360 console that will update XNA Game Launcher to the newest release. If you are not ready to move to 1.0 Refresh on Windows, do not worry; the Xbox 360 version is compatible with 1.0 and 1.0 Refresh.
> 
> We have gone over many of the features outlined in the [announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2007/03/08/announcing-the-xna-game-studio-express-update) we made at GDC 2007. One thing we did not really cover previously is compatibility. The entire team made a conscious effort to maintain compatibility with this release.
> 
> - Your game should just recompile in 1.0 Refresh with no changes required.
> - Any game that is compiled should run fine if you have 1.0 Refresh installed.
> - As mentioned, you can continue to use 1.0 on your Windows computer with 1.0 Refresh on the Xbox 360 console.
> - Games that are built on 1.0 Refresh may run on 1.0; however, if you are using new functions or features in the XNA Framework (such as font functionality), it will not work properly. 
> 
> You can download the XNA Framework 1.0 Refresh for including in your installer as you start to upgrade your games.
> 
> Finally, please make sure to take a look at the [readme](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/aa937796) for any last minute information about the release. We would love your feedback on this release, so please head over to the [XNA Creators Club forums](http://creators.xna.com/forums/default) and leave a message.

So what are you waiting for?
