Seems I’m getting notice more and more these day’s, always good.

I got a mention in an [interview](http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20061215/sheffield_01.shtml) with Microsoft Dave Mitchell about my involvement in the [XBOX360Homebrew](http://xbox360homebrew.com/default) contest. (Will get round to updating HACK-1 in time)

[XNATutorial](http://www.xnatutorial.com/) blog gave me a mention in the [monthly updates](http://www.xnatutorial.com/?p=60) (nice!)

And now a new site has sprung up called [NewsXNA](http://www.newsxna.com/), looks good so far, although only containing links to other resource site but shows a lot of promise.

Suggest you add it to your favorite links and head over there once in a while.

Merry Xmas and a Happy new year to you all

P.S

As a bit of a teaser I should hopefully blogging up a more detailed Camera Guide (not tutorial, just reference) and some info on terrain creation and management.

Sorry nothing on Shaders yet, just bussyyy, for some reason
