I’ve been very quite of late, especially on my Blog.  Now this isn’t because of anything sinister or just laziness, I’ve just been really REALLY busy.

<figure id="attachment_3628" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3628" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/assets/img/wordpress/2014/01/il_570xN.534199052_s088.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-3628 " alt="Just busy OK!!" src="/assets/img/wordpress/2014/01/il_570xN.534199052_s088-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="/assets/img/wordpress/2014/01/il_570xN.534199052_s088-150x150.jpg 150w, /assets/img/wordpress/2014/01/il_570xN.534199052_s088-432x432.jpg 432w, /assets/img/wordpress/2014/01/il_570xN.534199052_s088-268x268.jpg 268w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3628" class="wp-caption-text">Just busy OK!!</figcaption></figure>

Here’s a little run down of what I’ve been up to:

- I’m writing a book on Unity2D for PacktPub (Mastering Unity2D) – Will share more when I can on this, promise.  But it will be AWESOME!
- Working heavily behind the scenes with @ID\_XBOX with what ever they throw my way, or just chasing them to help improve things with a small group of others. (ID will be the community we always wanted with XNA, MS share this vision)
- Still working hard maintaining both MonoGame NuGet packages and updating the PCL build I publish
- Working on an new factory to generate the MonoGame PCL build with Dean Ellis (MonoGameTeam fame)
- Managing the goings on the the AdRotator solution, everything from answering queries to setting up the new GitHub site for Version 2 (we’re moving V2 there to enable easier collaboration)
- Pestering Gergely Orosz to hurry up and finish / get a test version out of the new WinJS version of AdRotator V2 😀 (name and shame!! :P) and pestering myself to keep up the pace with other aspects of the V2 branch.
- Improving and building new MonoGame samples for the upcoming release
- Updating and managing a Charity community site for the condition my son has (PWS for those who ask)
-  Reading, Reading, Researching, Hacking 😀

Somewhere in all this I also find time for work and my family (or is it the other way around)

Will get back on a more regular schedule once I can free some some spare clock cycles, most likely on MonoGame and / or Xbox One development (likely Unity based and / or services)

 

Phew, now errm, back to work.
