As promised here is the recording of the webcast session I did for AT&T on Augmented Reality with Windows Phone.

It was great going through this stuff and hopefully inspiring more people to think beyond with their apps and bring in the real world to augment users experiences!

Items that were covered in the session were:

> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/031.gif)    Recap on what it means to have Augmented Reality  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/031.gif)    Review of the different types of AR solutions  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/031.gif)    A High level description of what sensors and inputs you can use to augment your solution  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/031.gif)    A Run down of the top 3 AR toolkits for Windows Phone in both Silverlight and XNA  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/031.gif)    A code walkthrough of a Silverlight solution using SLARToolkit  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/031.gif)    A Code walkthrough of a 3D SilverXNA project also using the SLARToolkit  
> ![align=](http://www.dotnetscraps.com/samples/bullets/031.gif)    Q&A
