Browsing on my blogs (as you do) I happily read around the XNA Teams blogs over the last few days (I’m working in India at the moment so do not have much time for it).

I return to my blog list a little later to find yet another post has jumped on the XNA Team blog.

WOW

Just when you thought you might have o wait another year for XNA GSW 2.0 for new fixes patches and enhancements to the XNA Framework, all the jazzy things we want to do that we have to do ourselves currently (Seen a lot of request and workarounds on the forum of late)

Low and behold there is now going to be a patch to GSE in April and man what a fix and feature list, pretty much everything thats been asked for on the connect site and a bit more (also a bit less as well, the truly hard things will just have to wait I suppose)
