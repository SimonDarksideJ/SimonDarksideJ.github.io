One of the many reasons I  do not seem to get anything done these days is because I am soo damn busy, if it is not family it is work, if it is not work it is usually because I am writing samples or articles for someone else.  One day I will take time for me but it is not today.

DZone has just published another article of mine that I got asked to provide to give an insight to what most indie devs really need, a damn good game engine in order to quickly build their dreams and bring them to fruition easy and more importantly cheaply ![Open-mouthed smile](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile15.png)

So I have done a high level comparison (with a fair bit of in-depth content)  of both Unity 3D and SunBurn, putting the two engines head to head in areas like:

> ![align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)    Lighting  
> ![align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)    Customisation and plug-ins  
> ![align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)    Pricing

So spend a few minutes of your time reading my hard earned efforts and investigations and save yourself some legwork.

# Mumblings

In the area of platforms things may have (probably?) moved on regarding what platforms SunBurn could / would / should support based on my last article ([\<Link\>](http://darkgenesis.zenithmoon.com/?p=643)) so their could be even more reasons to consider SunBurn if you are that way inclined, but if you need it now that Unity3D definitely has the edge for the moment.

Or does it? ![Open-mouthed smile](/assets/img/wordpress/2012/07/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile15.png)
