Over on [Gamedev](http://www.gamedev.net/) the [Four Elements V](http://www.gamedev.net/community/contest/4e5/) competition has just ended, a good few entrant there, head over and have a look.

Now the reason for this post is that on the forums for the competition, one of the entrants has posted a MONSTER set of links to [FREE game resources](http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=324643). Everything from game engines(and source) to sound and art resources.

Have a gander [HERE](http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=324643), and grab what you need!!

Darkside

There are a load of other resources for the noob and experienced alike including [**Game Programming Beginners Guide**](http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/davegpg/) and [**How do I make games? A Path to Game Development**](http://www.gamedev.net/reference/design/features/makegames/), both articles are very good, they are a few years old now but still worth a read as the concepts are still sound.
