Who says you do not get nothing in Life for free – Well you can

Over at the lovely house of "Windows Vista" magazine, you can win one of 25 copies of Windows Vista on release (January), so if you like free stuff, head on over and have a look.

Then also have a few other competitions with more to come so it’s also work subscribing to their Blog to keep up to date!

happy motoring
