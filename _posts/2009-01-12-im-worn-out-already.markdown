Well I have been busy of the last week and even more so today.  I have finally setup my [new blog](http://faux-motion.blogspot.com/) (the old one will remain for now as I have stated) and got a little intro up there already.  Not to get too excited yet though, I am still working on chapter 1 for the 3D modeling tutorial, but it is coming along nicely.  I am always very critical when it comes to the beginning of such things as if you don’t set the stage properly and get everyone to understand the terminology to be used, you can get in to all sorts of troubles later on.

Still if you want to know how I’ve got here, it is an interesting read.  yuck. ![Tongue out](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)

On another note, further to my introduction to [Dark Omen Games](http://www.mquandt.com/dog/), I have dropped a little note on the new website for our merry little band, absolutely no mentions of Kate Winslet’s acceptance speech at all, hmmm.

So if your still interested to follow my ramblings in this world and a little 3D tutorial nonsense, find me over here at [http://faux-motion.blogspot.com/](http://faux-motion.blogspot.com/ "http://faux-motion.blogspot.com/")

For a little something to slip in to while I get the first post read, head over to [Stromcode](http://www.stromcode.com/category/xna/), Rick Strom has a few [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) tutorials there which are pretty good IMHO, a bit more of a do as I say tutorial rather than a learn how to do, but it is good to walk-through nonetheless.

Another honorable mention (thanks to [Charles “RandomChaos” Humphrey](http://xna-uk.net/blogs/randomchaos/default)again), is that there is a special XNA Exporter for Blender, which can be found on the [Triple B Games](http://www.triplebgames.com/downloads.html) site, this python script sorts out your Blender export and even adds collision boundaries for your models, saving you time calculating them in game (if that is what you need), always worth a look.

That is it from me here for now, so see you over at [Faux motion](http://faux-motion.blogspot.com/) in the future, do not forget to update your blogroll.
