As some of you may know, I’m currently full into the [XBOX360Homebrew](http://xbox360homebrew.com/default) contest with my mini game Hack-1 (working title).

Of Late finding time to work on the project has been hard (as life is I suppose), Work, Family, social life (or lack of) and not to mention LOST, Battlestar Galactica , etc….. the list goes on damn them.

Well I had a recent spurt of activity and got the main game bits working now (although not that pretty yet) and started looking at putting some screens around the game (Start Screen, Menu, exit screen, etc…), after hours (well felt like hours more like 30 min’s or so), I came across [this site (Shakaware Software).](http://www.shakaware.com/ "Shakaware Software")  The guy has written a Menu Component for XNA, WOW….

It looks nice (better then my game at the moment), has button animation for mouse hovering, and even lets you click the buttons!!!.

As another interesting feature it also comes with a Credits component, for errrr, drawing credits, looks nice.

Now, I spent all last night updating this puppy to BETA 2 and made a start adding it as a component to my game, when I have time (not much mind), i’ll finish tidying up the code and post it on Codeplex (With a good mention of the Author no less).

If anyone want me to post the Code sooner, albeit the untidy version, then post comments, if there are enough then I’ll make time.

Now where did I leave my code again!
