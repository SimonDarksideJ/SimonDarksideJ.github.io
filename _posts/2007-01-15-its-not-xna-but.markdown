Strange things come my way from time to time, this one has to be the strangest.

There is a Big competition going on now called [The Imagine Cup,](http://imaginecup.com/) this contest has several arms and one of these being the Project Hoshimi Programming Battle.

[Project Hoshimi](http://www.projecthoshimi.com/Default) is a game (of sorts) in where you develop computer AI to defeat viruses and bad AI inside a human body, sound strange?, it’s in it’s third year now and the game itself when running looks great and has a large following.

So if your interested in AI or looking as some funny graphics head over to [Project Hoshimi](http://www.projecthoshimi.com/Default) and have a look, or if your really into a challenge and might like to win about $8000, then enter the Project Hoshimi section of the Imagine Cup.

Good luck if you do!!
