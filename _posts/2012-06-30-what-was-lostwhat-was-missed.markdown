Well I’ve been remiss for a while (as with a lot of my fellow colleagues of late here on XNA-UK) due to work constraints, holidays and sheer numbness of endless projects and secret sauce.

On returning to the world from a non stop journey of excitement (well for the kids at least) to the wonderful resort of Disneyland Paris (EuroDisney?), I return exhausted and to a pile of paper behind my Front door and an almost endless stream of the electronic kind on my return to work, as is always the case.

Now I find myself on the other side of that and my concerns turn back to the wonderful world of Windows Phone 7 and XNA (with some obvious Silverlight overtones thanks to Mango) and I find myself researching additional material for a project I’ve been called to answer to (willingly of course) and found myself perusing the Education content on the AppHub.


# !What a surprise!

Not what i was expecting because there has been little announcement (either that or I was sleeping) about the wrath of new content added to the hub especially with Windows Phone 7 in mind, I seem unable to find reference, tweet or notification about when or how this content was added but by golly it is truly amazing.

In short here is the headlines (and by no means all of) the new content on the App Hub, which if you are making or thinking of making games for Windows Phone 7 you should absolutely take note of:

As you can see there is a lot of really cool new stuff and even more located on the AppHub educational content section, so i suggest you get yourself over there and check out this fantastic wealth of information.

Just remember it is there to learn from or build your games using the code within (fell free to cut and paste all you like).

Now I must again sleep!
