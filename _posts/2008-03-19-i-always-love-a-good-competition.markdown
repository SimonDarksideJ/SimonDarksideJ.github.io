Competitions are always a good thing as they make people strive to compete and bring out their best work (or not in my case, hack-1 was never finished enough for my likes when i published it for the XBOX360Homebrew Contest).

Time being what it is these days there’s no way I can drag myself through another competition, but thankfully there are people who can, in this case Ziggy has started up yet another Tutorial contest over on his Ziggyware site.

[ ![ /></a></p>
<p align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)This has always been hugely popular in the past and provided many excellent tutorials, feel free to also ](http://www.ziggyware.com/news.php?readmore=639 "Ziggyware Tutorial Contest")[browse through](http://www.ziggyware.com/articles.php) the results of the other contest, lots of good stuff for everyone from beginner to experienced XNA developers.

P.S I’m still going to be routing for [Catalin Zima](http://www.catalinzima.com/), mainly because his work is great and he has won the last few comps ;-), Sorry to disappoint anyone else, you just have to step up your game!! (that means YOU!!!)

On the flip side [George Clingerman](http://geekswithblogs.net/clingermangw/Default) has been reinventing himself of late (lie Madonna but with a little less makeup) and hes been rewriting a lot of his old tutorials, the latest series to get the revitalisation treatment is his Wizard tutorial series.

Wizard gets asked to take a bath

This tutorial takes a walk through the 2D park and is currently focusing on character development (displaying a sprite and giving it actions and things to do), the series looks as promising as ever and knowing George, should have a few nice extra surprises along the way.  So keep a lookout on [Georges Developments](http://geekswithblogs.net/clingermangw/Default) over @ [XNADevelopment.com](http://www.xnadevelopment.com/) (now that he seems to be taking a rest from being constantly on for forums to do some actual Work!!)
