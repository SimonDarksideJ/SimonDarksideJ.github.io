It’s not that often that I’ll comment on other peoples game ideas in my own blog but today is an exception.

Ever thought about jotting your dreams down as soon as you wake up, then take those dreams to create an interesting game.  I used to jot down my dreams for a while when I was younger, in the end got scared and thought it best that they were left for my subconscious to worry about, although I might start again now after reading what Danc has been doing.

Over on the [Lost Garden blog](http://www.lostgarden.com/index.html), he has been doing just this and in one particular dream actually play testing his final work on a new game (that he hadn’t written yet, spooky.  Quick call Maulder and Scully!), quickly after waking up he’s jotted it all down and come out with what looks like a unique idea for a game.

<p>“Celestial Music” is a cause and effect game involving music, music that is between planets.  The design is well thought out and sounds good.</p>
