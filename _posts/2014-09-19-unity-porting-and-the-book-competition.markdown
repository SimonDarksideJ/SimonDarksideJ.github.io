It’s been a fun ride over the past year, I’ve written a Unity book and I’ve attended over 4 Unity porting events for Microsoft and Nokia, it’s fair to say Unity and I have been on good terms this year :D.

All this work evangelising and book work has meant I’ve not been as able to dedicate time to my own game projects or even update my blog as frequently as I would like, not a bad thing considering I’m still out there doing my Game Development evangelist role and helping others to make great games on as many platforms as possible, hopefully next year will calm down and I’ll do more… Maybe 😀

> **Note: the book draw competition is now closed, results have been posted here: http://wp.me/p3o0M2-1dV**

Now to my first post in a while, I bring you news of two great and important events for me:


# [Unity porting events are back!](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail?EventID=1032596026&Culture=en-GB&community=0 "Glasgow Unity Porting lab registration")

The roadshow is back on in the UK for the wildly successful Unity porting events, starting this time in Glasgow.  There have been many of these events all around the world and literally hundreds of devs have received first class support getting their Games and even plug-ins ported over to support the Windows 8 and Windows Phone platforms.

I’ll be attending as usual however this time I’ll be bringing goodies of my own as well, 5 discount codes for my recent book. Will have to figure out how to share them out!  First 5 ported on the day maybe 😀

Here’s what MS evangelist Lee Stott had to say on the matter!

**Microsoft & Unity are hosting a series of Unity porting days across the UK and we would love to see you there!**

**Attend and receive a token for FREE registration to the Microsoft App Store!**

> Even more awesome now that Dev Centre accounts are LIFE

Over the last 12 months, Windows 8 and Windows Phone market share has increased rapidly. More and more consumers are purchasing Windows Phones and tablets and we are seeing amazing success on the Windows ecosystem from game developers with titles such as:

- **Reindeer Round-Up** from Christian West – over 10,000 paid downloads in just 8 days following his port at the London Unity porting event
- **Wilson’s Adventure from Richard Hawkins** – getting over 148k downloads in 3 weeks since his port at the London Unity porting event

Now it’s your turn to share in the success. Bring your laptop plus existing game along to our porting day and we will help you port your title in one day!

**Agenda**

| 8.30am – 9am | Arrival and room allocation of Mac to Windows |
| 9am – 9.10am | Welcome to Windows Porting Event Microsoft/Nokia/Unity |
| 9.10am – 10.00am | Porting Games to Windows 8 and Windows Phone using Unity – Unity Evangelist |
| 10am – 11am | Getting to Grips with Unity 5 and Unity new features – Unity Evangelist |
| 11am – 11.10pm | Allocate teams to rooms |
| 11am – 6pm | Porting of Games to Windows (Working Lunch) |
| 5pm – 6pm | Beers and Pizza |
| 6pm – 7pm | Pack-up and depart |

As you can see a fun filled and exciting event.

> When we were at Glasgow last time we also got a full walk-through the awesome large screen 3D experience at the Digital Design Studio.  It truly is an awesome thing to see as well.  I just wanted to hook up Unity to it and play stuff!!

All I’d say is only register if you are going to actually attend, this ensures there are places for everyone who has a project to port or has a final project ready to submit to the Windows Store.  We’ve seen a fair number of registrations not turn up to these events and this just blocks actual attendees from registering.  Remember places are limited!


### [For more details on the event, see the event registration link here](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail?EventID=1032596026&Culture=en-GB&community=0 "Glasgow Unity Porting lab registration")

Stay tuned for more events across the UK including Manchester in October!


# It’s competition time!

I always love a competition, especially when it’s me giving stuff away (hmm, or is it the other way round…..)

The competition comes in two forms, for the first I’ll be bringing along several discount codes for my recently published Unity 2D book to the Glasgow Unity porting day (and hopefully more to the Manchester one)
