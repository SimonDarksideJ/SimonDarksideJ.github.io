[XNA Game Studio Express (Beta) Now Available!](http://blogs.msdn.com/xna/archive/2006/08/30/731941)

The day has come! You can download XNA Game Studio Express (Beta) from the following location on the XNA Developer Center [http://msdn.com/directx/xna/gse](http://msdn.com/directx/xna/gse).
One reason we release beta software is to put it in the hands of the community and start getting feedback on what we’ll be releasing. How you give feedback depends on the type of feedback you have.
We hope many of you have already joined the XNA Beta Program through the Microsoft Connect Web site [http://connect.microsoft.com](http://connect.microsoft.com/). If you haven’t signed up at the Microsoft Connect Site, it couldn’t be easier.

1. Sign in using your Windows Live ID or Passport account (if you haven’t already).
2. Click Available Connections.
3. Scroll down. In the table that lists the various programs available, select XNA Game Studio Express Beta 1, and then click Apply.
4. After filling out the short survey, you will be enrolled automatically.
