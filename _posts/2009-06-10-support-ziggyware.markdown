[Ziggyware.com](http://www.ziggyware.com/)is one of the best sites for XNA resources and has been around since the beginning.  It including Articles, Tutorials, News and even an Image of The Day section where you can look at what other people are doing.

But that is not all. One of the things that sets Ziggyware apart from others is that about two or three times each year, it holds a “XNA Articles Competition”. The result of this competition usually takes form in lots of top-quality tutorials and articles about stuff you can do with XNA. Ziggyware wants to repay the talented people that make these tutorials, so he gives them prizes. Because of this, from time to time, there is a call for donations, and now is such a time.

If you like to use the articles on Ziggyware, and if you want to help the site grow, prosper and continue to provide a constant stream of good XNA articles, you now have the chance to do so, by going on [Ziggy’s site](http://www.ziggyware.com/), and seeing [how you can help](http://www.ziggyware.com/news.php?readmore=1126).

I am currently a bit out of action at the mo which is hampering my efforts to get anything done but It seems even my good friend Charles from Dark Omen games has been plundering on without my help now and created some interesting Blender results with his own hands and imagination, check it out here on his [blog](http://xna-uk.net/blogs/randomchaos/default), there is [another video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCCYHgOrF10) on the same concept which just freaks me out.
