## XNA Games Studio Express

Just sounds great when saying it and looks like it should be a great hit, reducing the time and effort required to build multi-platform titles (albeit Microsoft software only) and gives the community a low-cost option of getting their work seen by the outside world.

For those of you not in the know yet, I would suggest hiking over to the [Microsoft XNA developers homepage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/xna/) for more details but in short, the studio is an add-on express studio which builds upon C# express and the .NET2/.NET compact framework (depending on what you're releasing to Windows/XBOX360). It gives a wealth of support for game developers (from beginner to pro) for creating games and content and with a small yearly fee ($99 Per Year) you can test and publish your games to Xbox Live for the community to download and play.

## Back now to the main subject of this blog – the Game Loop

Just recently I spent some time browsing through the rest of the XNA teams blogs (there are a few), I already knew and keep an eye out for [Tom Millers Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/tmiller/default) (good info) and also read [Dave "Let's Kill Dave" Wellers](http://letskilldave.com/default) blog (for a funnier outlook on life and XNA).

But today I came across Rick Hoskin's blog (who recently has started blogging in the team, so new he's not even done his profile yet, lol), he's a Pro game programmer and provides some very good insight to good programming styles, Do's and Do Not's.

Reading down I came across a nice little gem about [a better game loop to use,](http://blogs.msdn.com/rickhos/archive/2005/03/30/403952) he goes on further with [some updates](http://blogs.msdn.com/rickhos/archive/2005/05/06/415227) and even links to some further help on [Toms blog](https://blogs.msdn.com/tmiller/archive/2005/05/05/415008) (must have missed that one).

Just goes to show how much thought is required to choose a good game loop from the start and how much controversy there is on the subject.

Happy Blogging/Reading!
