&lt;p&gt;There are those who either do not like or prefer not to use big heavy-hitting coding IDE’s, prefer the raw metal of cutting their teeth on code using nothing but their wits (and a good spellchecker), thanks to MonoGame 3.8’s new .NET Core delivery approach they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MonoGame 3.8 Mac CLI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href=" https: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="MonoGame CLI for the win">aforementioned Command-line/Terminal (CLI) approach mentioned in <a href="https://darkgenesis.zenithmoon.com/monogame-blasts-into-the-future-with-dotnet-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="MonoGame blasts into the future">my previous article</a>, developers can (if they choose) use either a slimline code editing tool such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Visual Studio Code">VSCode</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Sublime text editor">Sublime</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Jetbrains Rider">Rider </a>or even just a trusty command-line/terminal window to build great games.

<p>Sure, you might miss some of the big-hitting features the larger packages might offer, but if you are starved for disk space, bandwidth or simply like your meat raw then the slimline editor is much more attractive option.</p>

<h2>Getting started with CLI for MAC</h2>

<p>The MonoGame team took particular interest in ensuring everything you need to know about setting up MonoGame 3.8 on your Mac for CLI was all up to scratch and you kind find the article (as well as others) here:</p>

<p>If you scroll past the Visual Studio for Mac sections you will find the instructions for:</p>

<li>Fin</li>
</ol>

<p>The process is fairly easy and should not take you more than one or two cups of coffee to get through (depending on your internet connection)</p>

<p>If you prefer, I’ve uploaded a video walking through the process here:</p>
