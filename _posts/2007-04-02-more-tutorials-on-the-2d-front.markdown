When most people start when jumping into game development, they begin with simple 2D games.

_(Or at least they should, lost count of the amount of times a noob has jumped up, come up with the idea for the next best Doom or FEAR and then got stumped in 3D without the valuable 2D background, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!!)._

Anyway…  a handy site was mentioned in the [XNA creators club forums](http://creators.xna.com/forums/default) (in case you didn’t already know, the old XNA forums on [msdn.com/xna](http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default?ForumGroupID=20&SiteID=1)are no longer visited by the XNA Team much), a site dedicated to some handy 2D tile based games and a load of tutorials to boot.

Head over to [Jnrdev’s page](http://jnrdev.72dpiarmy.com/) for some much needed brainwashing!
