Over on my other blog (my 3D modelling blog) [Faux Motion](http://faux-motion.blogspot.com/), I’ve recently been posting a series of videos to help users out in getting models in to SunBurn.

As mentioned on the Online UK Techdays conference there are a few prerequisites on models for use in SunBurn, so the series aims to help out with that.

There are also two additional trouble shooting videos highlight specific issues when importing models in to SunBurn and how to correct them.
