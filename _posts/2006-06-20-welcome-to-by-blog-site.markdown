Welcome all to my blog site

 

I decided from the experiences and resources i’ve gained from my beginnings into game development that I’d share some of the pains and moments of light i’ve endured.

 

Hopefully helpfull for anyone else thinking of starting along thsame track.

 

 

For info

I am not a professional Game developer, I’m doing this for personal development and Part time as it is

(Other little things keep getting in the way like Life, Family and work – damn pesky things)

 

I got into this because (like a lot of people who do) like games, or more rather I’m a fan of the stories that games tell.

 

If alone the wy I make a good gam or few then all the better (or even some cash but that is not my goal).

 

I do have one Game idea in mind (for an end result) which is very ambtious (a game which would be called Life, I may release the details sometime later) and may never ge fully realised but it is an end goal, I’m likely to make several other games along the way to learn and grow towards this.

 

P.S

and it will have sharp pointy teeth, so beware!! (damn rabbits)

 

I will appoligise in advace for some of my humor through this blog as I’ve been very tainted by the Python gang (Monty that is and not the language) and can digress all to quickly. ![](http://thegamedevspace.spaces.msn.com/mmm2006-06-19_17.24/rte/emoticons/smile_teeth.gif)

 

So if you like please enjoy my development ramblings and findings
