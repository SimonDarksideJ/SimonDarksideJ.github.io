Welcome all to my blog site.

I decided from the experiences and resources I've gained from my beginnings into game development that I'd share some of the pains and moments of light I've endured.

Hopefully helpful for anyone else thinking of starting along the same track.

## For Info

I am not a professional Game developer, I'm doing this for personal development and part time as it is (other little things keep getting in the way like Life, Family and work – damn pesky things).

I got into this because (like a lot of people who do) I like games, or more rather I'm a fan of the stories that games tell.

If along the way I make a good game or few then all the better (or even some cash but that is not my goal).

I do have one Game idea in mind (for an end result) which is very ambitious (a game which would be called Life, I may release the details sometime later) and may never be fully realized but it is an end goal, I'm likely to make several other games along the way to learn and grow towards this.

## PS

And it will have sharp pointy teeth, so beware!! (damn rabbits)

I will apologize in advance for some of my humor through this blog as I've been very tainted by the Python gang (Monty that is and not the language) and can digress all too quickly.

So if you like please enjoy my development ramblings and findings.
