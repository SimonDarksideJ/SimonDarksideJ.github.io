Catching up on the webcasts Iâ€™ve done now for AT&T, hereâ€™s the recording from the event in September last year.

[AT&T Meet the Expert â€“ Build a XNA Game in 60 minutes](http://vimeo.com/17441935) from [Simon Jackson](http://vimeo.com/user5386443) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

As a brief run down the session covered end to end:

Iâ€™ve re-run this one several times now at user groups across the UK (although not as much as I would have liked, I had to turn down some invites due to distance and cost, but I hope to try and sort someting out in the future)

Next up the recording of the first event from March on Basic Silverlight development (a change is always good ðŸ˜€ )
