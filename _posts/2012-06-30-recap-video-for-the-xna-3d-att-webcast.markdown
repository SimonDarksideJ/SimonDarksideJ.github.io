Catching up on the webcasts I’ve done now for AT&T, here’s the recording from the event in September last year.

[AT&T Meet the Expert – Build a XNA Game in 60 minutes](http://vimeo.com/17441935) from [Simon Jackson](http://vimeo.com/user5386443) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

As a brief run down the session covered end to end:

> ![align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)    3D setup on the phone  
> ![align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)    Drawing 3D models  
> ![align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)    Player input in 3D on the phone  
> ![align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)    Sound and music  
> ![align=](assets/img/posts/image-not-found.png)    3D basic collision detection

I’ve re-run this one several times now at user groups across the UK (although not as much as I would have liked, I had to turn down some invites due to distance and cost, but I hope to try and sort someting out in the future)

Next up the recording of the first event from March on Basic Silverlight development (a change is always good 😀 )
