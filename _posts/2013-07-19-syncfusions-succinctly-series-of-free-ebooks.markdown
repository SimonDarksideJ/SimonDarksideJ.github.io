The main reason I have been so quite of late is because I have been focusing on entries for Nokia’s @DVLUP challenges in the hope to earn some XP and get some fantastic goodies.  Just about finished on my last project and decided to have a breather (also they extended my current challenge, more time is always good for QA)

While up, I was looking at all the resources out there that is available to fellow programmers and developers (yes, there IS a difference so get off my back ![Smile with tongue out](/assets/img/wordpress/2013/07/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png)), more importantly those that are friendly to my family strained wallet.  In other words FREE.

One of the biggest out there is [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview)’s “[Succinctly](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks?UTM_medium=simonblogreview)” series, one of the largest free (and still growing) set of technical books covering everything from languages, to source control systems and beyond.

So let’s see what we got.

It feels an age ago when [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) started sending out tweets about new [ebooks](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) they were giving away for free alongside their commercial offerings.  Surprisingly it is only been just over a year.  I got the first Succinctly book (JQuery Succinctly) back in May 2012 only a couple of months after grabbing the initial release of Metro Studio.

It was truly amazing that such a resource was being given out for FREE no less, they weren’t the longest books (averaging around 100 pages) or even bulging at the seams but they told you exactly what you needed to know to get the job done.  For the price they were just out of this world.

The series has continued since that time with a staggering 19 books already out and the promise of much much more, it just goes to show how much [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) value the community and it is a great business vehicle to get you interested in their commercial offerings.

The free stuff does not stop there as [Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) also offer an Icon repository tool with over 2500 icons called  [MetroStudio](http://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio?UTM_medium=simonblogreview) (or should that be ModernStudio now ![Smile with tongue out](/assets/img/wordpress/2013/07/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png))

You cannot argue with the price and the wealth of information in each book is just fantastic.  Need I say more?


###### Pros:

- Great range of books
- Each book is aimed at the beginner, little or no foreknowledge is required
- Available in PDF or Kindle so choose your reader


###### Cons:

- Most books cover only one way of doing things, e.g. the GIT book talks about GIT command line (aka unix) but I am a UI guy
- So hard to have Con’s when what you get is way more than you pay for it, by a mile ![Open-mouthed smile](/assets/img/wordpress/2013/07/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile1.png)
