[![Nebulon](http://darkomengames.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/nebBoxart.jpg "Nebulon")](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025855025c)I am happy to announce that Nebulon has passed the peer review process for XBOX LIVE Community Games and is now available for purchase in the territories where XBLCG is available.

The game costs 200 Microsoft Points, and is a lot of fun. (As the Peer Reviewers have told us) This has been a great learning experience for Dark Omen Games, and we are happy to see that Nebulon is the first game from DOG to make it to XBLCG.

DaphydTheBard did a great job with the game, as the peer reviewers have told us, and we hope that you will check out the game and support us to continue developing for what will soon be called XBOX LIVE Indies.
